**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a complete Document Management System (DMS) with hierarchical file/folder structure, role-based access control, mandatory tagging for quick search, and integrated dashboard view across 3 development phases.

## What Was Built

### Core Features

1. **Hierarchical File/Folder System**
   - Unlimited folder depth with auto-generated paths

## Technical Architecture

### Database Models

**Folder**:
```
- name, description, path
- organization, parentFolder
- createdBy, updatedBy
- isPublic, allowedRoles
- metadata (fileCount, subfolderCount, totalSize)
```

**DMSFile**:
```
- filename, originalName, filePath
- mimeType, fileType, size
- organization, folder, uploadedBy
- tags[], description
- version, isLatest, parentFile
- allowedRoles[]
- downloadCount, lastDownloadedAt
- metadata (pages, dimensions, checksum)
```

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| /api/dms/folders | GET | List folders with optional files |
| /api/dms/folders | POST | Create new folder |
| /api/dms/files | GET | Search and filter files |
| /api/dms/files | POST | Upload file with tags |
| /api/dms/latest | GET | Get latest uploaded files |
| /api/tasks/assigned | GET | Get assigned reviews/approvals |

### Component Structure

```

        └── Latest Documents (with tags)
```

## Access Control

### Upload Permissions
- ✅ org_admin
- ✅ atc_supervisor
- ✅ atc
- ❌ editor (read-only)
- ❌ viewer (read-only)

### View Permissions
- All authenticated users can view files in their organization
- Access filtered by file's `allowedRoles` array
- Folder access controlled by `allowedRoles` array

## Data Flow

### File Upload Flow
```
User → FileUploadModal
  ↓ (selects file)
File validation (size, type)
  ↓ (adds tags)
Tag validation (1-20 tags)
  ↓ (submits)
POST /api/dms/files
  ↓
- Generate unique filename
- Calculate checksum
- Save to /public/uploads/dms/
- Create database record
  ↓
Success → Refresh list
```

### Dashboard Data Flow
```
ATCDashboard loads
  ↓
Promise.all([
  GET /api/checklists/templates
  GET /api/tasks/assigned
  GET /api/dms/latest?limit=10
])
  ↓
Extract tags from responses
  ↓
Render tabs with data
  ↓
User filters by tags
  ↓
Client-side filtering
  ↓
Display filtered results
```
