Summary

  I've successfully completed the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) integration for the eAIP Document Management System. Here's what was implemented:

  What Was Completed

  1. Installed Google Cloud Storage SDK - Added @google-cloud/storage package (55 packages installed successfully)
  2. Created GCS Utility Library (/Users/davideraro/eAIP/src/lib/googleCloudStorage.ts)
    - getGCSClient(): Initializes Storage client with three authentication methods
    - uploadToGCS(): Uploads files with metadata and returns signed URLs
    - getSignedUrl(): Generates temporary access URLs (configurable expiration)
    - deleteFromGCS(): Deletes files from bucket
    - moveFileInGCS(): Moves files between paths
    - copyFileInGCS(): Copies files
    - fileExistsInGCS(): Checks file existence
    - getFileMetadata(): Retrieves file metadata
    - listFilesInFolder(): Lists files in directory
    - generateGCSPath(): Creates unique file paths with format: organizations/{orgId}/folders/{folderId}/{timestamp}-{random}-{filename}
  3. Updated File Upload API (/Users/davideraro/eAIP/src/app/api/dms/files/route.ts)
    - Removed local file system storage
    - Integrated GCS upload functionality
    - Files now stored in GCS with proper organization and folder structure
    - Generates signed URLs for secure file access
  4. Updated DMSFile Model (/Users/davideraro/eAIP/src/models/DMSFile.ts)
    - Added gcsUrl field for storing gs:// URLs
    - Added gcsPath in metadata for tracking GCS object paths
  5. Created Signed URL Refresh Endpoint (/Users/davideraro/eAIP/src/app/api/dms/files/[id]/url/route.ts)
    - Generates fresh signed URLs when they expire (1-hour validity)
    - Includes role-based access control
  6. Created Download Endpoint (/Users/davideraro/eAIP/src/app/api/dms/files/[id]/download/route.ts)
    - Handles file downloads via GCS signed URLs
    - Automatically increments download counters
    - 5-minute signed URL validity for downloads
  7. Updated FileFolderBrowser Component (/Users/davideraro/eAIP/src/components/dms/FileFolderBrowser.tsx)
    - File downloads now use the new download API endpoint
    - Seamlessly handles GCS-backed files
  8. Environment Configuration
    - Updated .env with GCS configuration placeholders
    - Created .env.example with complete documentation

  Required Configuration

  To use the GCS integration, you need to configure these environment variables in your .env file:

  # Google Cloud Storage Configuration
  GCS_PROJECT_ID=your-gcs-project-id
  GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name

  # Option 1: JSON credentials (recommended for production)
  GCS_CREDENTIALS_JSON='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"...","private_key":"...","client_email":"..."}'

  # Option 2: Path to key file (for local development)
  # GCS_KEY_FILE=/path/to/service-account-key.json

  How It Works

  1. File Upload: When a file is uploaded, it's sent to GCS with metadata including organization ID, folder ID, uploader, and checksum
  2. File Storage: Files are stored in GCS with organized paths: organizations/{orgId}/folders/{folderId}/{unique-filename}
  3. File Access: Files are accessed via signed URLs that expire after 1 hour for security
  4. File Download: Downloads use a dedicated endpoint that generates short-lived (5-minute) signed URLs and tracks download counts

  Security Features

  - Private by default: Files are not publicly accessible
  - Signed URLs: Temporary URLs that expire automatically
  - Role-based access: Users can only access files they have permissions for
  - Organization isolation: Files are segregated by organization

  The application is running successfully at http://localhost:3000 with all GCS functionality integrated and ready to use once you configure your GCS credentials.
