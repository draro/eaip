# FINAL UPDATED AVIATION CYBERSECURITY COMPLIANCE AUDIT REPORT

**System**: eAIP Editor - Electronic Aeronautical Information Publication Management System  
**Audit Date**: 2024  
**Frameworks**: GDPR, SOC 2, ICAO Standards, EUROCONTROL Spec 3.0, CAA Requirements  
**Industry**: Aviation / Air Traffic Management

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - FINAL REVISION

**Overall Risk Assessment**: `MEDIUM`

After reviewing the Google Cloud Storage configuration and understanding the Document Management System (DMS) context with Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) compliance requirements, the security posture is significantly better than initially assessed.

### Updated Compliance Score:

| Framework                  | Score     | Remarks                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| GDPR Compliance           | 55/100    | Improved - data retention justifiable        |
| SOC 2 Compliance          | 65/100    | Good foundation with gaps                    |
| Aviation Security         | 80/100    | Strong - CAA compliant                       |
| Data Protection           | 70/100    | Good encryption, needs PII protection        |
| Transport Security        | 90/100    | Excellent TLS configuration                  |

## SOC 2 PRINCIPLES AUDIT

### 1. SECURITY (COMMON CRITERIA)

- ✅ NGINX hardened, TLS 1.3 enabled
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas protected by IP access list
- ✅ Access controls (JWT, admin roles)
- ⚠️ No 2FA for admin dashboard
- ⚠️ No endpoint rate limiting
- ⚠️ SOC 2 audit logging is incomplete

**Score**: 65/100

---

### 2. AVAILABILITY

- ✅ Health checks enabled
- ⚠️ No incident response runbooks
- ⚠️ Single GCP region (EUROPE)

**Score**: 70/100

---

### 3. PROCESSING INTEGRITY

- ✅ Data integrity during AIP conversion process
- ⚠️ No hash verification after PDF parse
- ⚠️ No integrity logs or checksums

**Score**: 55/100

---

### 4. CONFIDENTIALITY

- ✅ TLS 1.3 enforced
- ✅ Data encrypted at rest in GCS
- ✅ MongoDB encrypted by default
- ⚠️ No field-level encryption for PII
- ⚠️ Admin dashboard exposes list of documents to all admins

**Score**: 60/100

---

### 5. PRIVACY (GDPR ALIGNMENT)

- ⚠️ No user deletion/objection interface
- ⚠️ No DPIA
- ✅ Data storage is compliant with regional location (EU)
- ⚠️ No data minimization practices

**Score**: 55/100

---

## CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE: GCP

- ✅ GCS Bucket is private
- ⚠️ Service account permissions should be audited
- ✅ VPC firewall configured

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### High Priority
- [ ] Enable 2FA for admin access
- [ ] Implement audit logs for all admin actions
- [ ] Add endpoint rate limiting
- [ ] Field-level encryption for PII (e.g. names/emails)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Geo-redundancy for GCP
- [ ] Add document hash checks on parse
- [ ] Implement DPIA and GDPR deletion requests

---

## OVERALL COMPLIANCE STATUS

| Category               | Status       |
|------------------------|--------------|
| SOC 2                  | Partial ✅   |
| GDPR                  | Partial ✅   |
| Aviation Security      | ✅ Compliant |
| GCP Security Posture   | Moderate Risk |

---

**Conclusion**: The eAIP Editor platform meets a majority of aviation and cloud infrastructure best practices and is on track to reach SOC 2 readiness with several improvements. GDPR compliance is achievable with user-facing rights and documentation updates.
