# Workflow Fixes - Issue Resolution

## Issues Reported

### 1. ❌ Workflows saving prematurely when adding steps
**Problem**: When clicking "Add Step" button in the workflow builder, the form was being submitted and the user was redirected back to the workflows page, even though they weren't finished configuring the workflow.

### 2. ❌ Edit button crashing
**Problem**: Clicking the "Edit Workflow" button resulted in a crash because the edit page didn't exist.

---

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: Premature Form Submission
**Location**: `/src/components/WorkflowBuilder.tsx` line 278

**Root Cause**: The "Add Step" button was missing `type="button"` attribute.

```tsx
// BEFORE (Incorrect):
<button
  onClick={addStep}
  className="..."
>
  <Plus className="..." />
</button>
```

In HTML, when a `<button>` is inside a `<form>` without an explicit `type` attribute, it defaults to `type="submit"`. This meant that clicking "Add Step" was triggering the form submission, causing the workflow to save and navigate away.

### Issue 2: Missing Edit Page
**Location**: `/src/app/workflows/[id]/page.tsx` line 128

**Root Cause**: The view workflow page had an "Edit Workflow" button that linked to `/workflows/${workflow._id}/edit`, but this route didn't exist.

```tsx
<Button onClick={() => router.push(`/workflows/${workflow._id}/edit`)}>
  <Settings className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  Edit Workflow
</Button>
```

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Fix 1: Prevent Form Submission on Add Step

**File**: `/src/components/WorkflowBuilder.tsx`

**Change**: Added `type="button"` to the Add Step button

```tsx
// AFTER (Correct):
<button
  type="button"  // ← Added this
  onClick={addStep}
  className="w-20 h-20 rounded-2xl border-2 border-dashed border-blue-400 bg-blue-50 hover:bg-blue-100 hover:border-blue-500 flex items-center justify-center transition-all group shadow-sm"
>
  <Plus className="w-8 h-8 text-blue-600 group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform" />
</button>
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Clicking "Add Step" now only adds a step to the workflow
- ✅ Form does NOT submit
- ✅ User stays on the page to continue configuring
- ✅ Workflow only saves when user explicitly clicks "Save" or "Create Workflow"

### ✅ Fix 2: Create Edit Workflow Page

**File Created**: `/src/app/workflows/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (407 lines)

**Features Implemented**:

1. **Load Existing Workflow**
   - Fetches workflow data from API
   - Pre-populates all fields with current values
   - Loads workflow steps with positions

2. **Full Edit Capabilities**
   - Edit workflow name and description
   - Toggle active/inactive status
   - Toggle AIRAC alignment
   - Modify document types
   - Update workflow steps using WorkflowBuilder
   - Save changes via PUT request

3. **Safety Features**
   - Prevent editing of default workflows
   - Show clear message if workflow is read-only
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Validation of required fields
   - Loading and saving states

4. **User Experience**
   - Back button to return to view page
   - Cancel button to discard changes
   - Delete workflow option (with confirmation)
   - Visual feedback during save/load operations

**Code Structure**:
```tsx
export default function EditWorkflowPage() {
  // State management
  const [workflow, setWorkflow] = useState<Workflow | null>(null);
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [description, setDescription] = useState('');
  const [documentTypes, setDocumentTypes] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [steps, setSteps] = useState<WorkflowStep[]>([]);
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(true);
  const [airacAligned, setAiracAligned] = useState(false);

  // Fetch existing workflow
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchWorkflow();
    fetchUsers();
  }, [params.id]);

  // Handle form submission
  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Validation
    // PUT request to /api/workflows/:id
    // Navigate back on success
  };

  // Handle workflow deletion
  const handleDelete = async () => {
    // Confirmation dialog
    // DELETE request to /api/workflows/:id
    // Navigate to list on success
  };

  return (
    // Form with all fields
    // WorkflowBuilder component
    // Save/Cancel/Delete buttons
  );
}
```

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Workflow Model
Added AIRAC integration fields to workflow model:

```typescript
interface IWorkflowStep {
  // ... existing fields
  airacDeadline?: 'initial_submission' | 'final_submission' | 'review' | 'publication' | 'effective';
  daysBeforeEffective?: number;
}

interface IWorkflow {
  // ... existing fields
  airacAligned: boolean;
}
```

### 2. New AIRAC Workflow Template
Added pre-configured AIRAC-aligned workflow with 8 steps following ICAO deadlines:
- Draft (77+ days)
- Initial Submission (77 days)
- Technical Review (70 days)
- Final Submission (70 days)
- Regulatory Review (63 days)
- Publication Ready (56 days)
- Published (0-56 days)
