## Conclusion

The eAIP platform demonstrates strong aviation-specific functionality but faces significant security and compliance gaps that require immediate attention. The identified critical vulnerabilities pose existential risks to the organization, including potential data breaches, regulatory penalties, and loss of market access.

**The recommended investment of $230,000 over 6 months will:**
- Eliminate critical security vulnerabilities
- Achieve GDPR compliance
- Position for SOC 2 Type II certification
- Reduce annual risk exposure by $3.6M
- Enable enterprise market expansion

**Failure to act will result in:**
- Continued high-risk exposure ($4M+ annual expected loss)
- Inability to compete for enterprise contracts
- Regulatory enforcement actions
- Potential data breach and associated costs
- Loss of customer trust and market position

The audit findings are clear: **immediate action is required to protect the organization, its customers, and aviation operations that depend on this critical infrastructure.**
